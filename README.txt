Hello and welcome to SOLITAIRE!

1. INSTRUCTIONS
Incase you have lived under a rock and have never played solitaire before,
here are some rules and instructions:

- The aim of the game is to sort all the cards into the four suit piles at 
	the top right of the screen, from lowest (ace) to highest (king).
- There are 7 columns in the lower portion of the screen. The first column
	has one card, the second two, etc. The topmost card is face up.
- Only cards that are face up can be moved or have other face up cards placed
	on top of them, and these must be the opposite color to the card below.
- Cards within the columns must be in decending order with alternating color,
	from highest (king) to lowest (ace).
- The remaining 24 cards are in the deck, top left of the screen. You can click
	on the deck to draw a card, which you can then choose to add to 
	your columns. You can't reshuffle the deck.
- If you run out of cards in the deck, simply click again to flip the drawn
	pile back onto the deck.
- If there is an empty space in a column, only a king may be placed there.
- Click and drag cards to move them, and click again to drop them into place.
- You gain points for various moves:
	- 5 points if you move a card to a place within a column
	- 10 points if you move a card to a suit pile
	- 5 points for flipping a card to face up

HAVE FUN :)
